abstract = "The center of mass (CoM) is a key descriptor in the understanding and the analysis of bipedal locomotion. Some approaches are based on the premise that humans minimize the CoM vertical displacement. Other approaches express walking dynamics though the inverted pendulum model. Such approaches are contradictory in that they lead to two conflicting patterns to express the CoM motion: straight line segments for the first approaches and arcs of a circle for the second ones. In this paper we show that CoM motion is a trade-off between both patterns. Specifically CoM follows a curtate cycloid, which is the curve described by a point rigidly attached to a wheel rolling on a flat surface. We demonstrate that all the three parameters defining a curtate cycloid only depend on the height of the subjects."
