abstract = "In this paper, we propose a simulation framework which simultaneously computes both the design and the control of passive walkers. The problem of computing a design and a control is formulated as a single large-scale parametric optimal control problem on hybrid dynamics with path constraints (e.g. non sliding and non slipping contact constraints). Our framework relies on state-of-the-art numerical optimal control techniques and efficient computation of the multi-body rigid dynamics. It allows to compute both the parametrized model and the control of passive walkers on different scenarios, in only few seconds on a standard computer. The framework is illustrated by several examples which highlight the interest of the approach."
