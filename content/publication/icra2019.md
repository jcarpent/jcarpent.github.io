abstract = "It is nowadays well-established that locomotion can be written as a large and complex optimal control problem. Yet, current knowledge in numerical solver fails to directly solve it. A common approach is to cut the dimensionality by relying on reduced models (inverted pendulum, capture points, centroidal). However it is difficult both to account for whole-body constraints at the reduced level and also to define what is an acceptable trade-off at the whole-body level between tracking the reduced solution or searching for a new one. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a rigorous mathematical framework based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to enforce the consensus between the centroidal state dynamics at reduced and whole-body level. We propose an exact splitting of the whole-body optimal control problem between the centroidal dynamics (under-actuation) and the manipulator dynamics (full actuation), corresponding to a rearrangement of the equations already stated in previous works. We then describe with details how alternating descent is a good solution to implement an effective locomotion solver. We validate this approach in simulation with walking experiments on the HRP-2 robot."
