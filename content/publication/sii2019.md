abstract = "We introduce Pinocchio, an open-source software framework that implements rigid body dynamics algorithms and their analytical derivatives. Pinocchio does not only include standard algorithms employed in robotics (e.g. forward and inverse dynamics) but provides additional features essential for the control, the planning and the simulation of robots. In this paper, we describe these features and detail the programming patterns and design which make Pinocchio efficient. We also offer a short tutorial for easy handling of the framework."
