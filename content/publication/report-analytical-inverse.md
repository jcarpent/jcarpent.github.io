abstract = "In this short report, we briefly introduce a new algorithm to compute the analytical inverse of the joint space inertia matrix. Such inverse may be useful for several applications like the computation of the analytical derivatives of the forward dynamics. We also provide a free C++ implementation of this algorithm inside our C++ framework for rigid-body dynamics computations called Pinocchio."
