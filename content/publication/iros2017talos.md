abstract = "The upcoming generation of humanoid robots will have to be equipped with state-of-the-art technical features along with high industrial quality, but they should also offer the prospect of effective physical human interaction. In this paper we introduce a new humanoid robot capable of interacting with a human environment and targeting a whole range of industrial applications. This robot is able to handle weights of 6 Kg with an outstretched arm, and has powerful motors to carry out movements unavailable in previous generations of humanoid robots. Its kinematics has been specially designed for screwing and drilling motions. In order to make interaction possible with human operators, this robot is equipped with torque sensors to measure joint effort and high resolution encoders to measure both motor and joint positions. The humanoid robotics field has reached a stage where robustness and repeatibility is the next watershed. We believe that, this robot has the potential to become a powerful tool for the research community to successfully navigate this turning point, as the humanoid robot HRP-2 was in its own time."
