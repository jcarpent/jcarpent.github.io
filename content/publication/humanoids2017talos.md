abstract = "The upcoming generation of humanoid robots will have to be equipped with state-of-the-art technical features along with high industrial quality, but they should also offer the prospect of effective physical human interaction. In this paper we introduce a new humanoid robot capable of interacting with a human environment and targeting industrial applications. In order to identify the needed capabilities of this robot, experiments with a humanoid robot HRP-2 are described. Limitations are outlined and used together with the feedback from the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and other teams leading the field in creating new humanoid robots. The resulting robot is able to handle weights of 6 Kg with an out-stretched arm, and has powerful motors to carry out fast movements. Its kinematics has been specially designed for screwing and drilling motions. In order to make interaction possible with human operators, this robot is equipped with torque sensors to measure joint effort and high resolution encoders to measure both motor and joint positions.<\br> The humanoid robotics field has reached a stage where robustness and repeatability is the next watershed. We believe that this robot has the potential to become a powerful tool for the research community to successfully navigate this turning point, as the humanoid robot HRP-2 was in its own time."
