# Biography
I'm Justin Carpentier, a postdoctoral researcher at the interface between Robotics, Machine Learning and Control. My research is devoted to the embedding of Optimal Control theory inside the formalism of Machine Learning, with Humanoid Robotics as a main target application. 
Since September 2018, I'm a postdoctoral fellow inside the [Willow research group](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) at INRIA Paris in France. 

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher inside the [Gepetto research group](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php) at LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse, France.
Previously, I was a PhD candidate in the same [Gepetto research group](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php). 
My research was at this time devoted to the understanding of the computational fundations of anthropomorphic locomotion. On one side, I highligthed some mechanismes underlying bipedalism among human beings. On the other side, I developed new mathematical formulations for the locomotion of humanoid robots.

I received my degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with highest honor from [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/) in 2013. In 2014, I was a visiting student inside the [Optimization in Robotics and Biomechanics](http://orb.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) group with Katja Mombaur at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. 

## Main collabarotors
