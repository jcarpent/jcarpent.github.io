# Biography

Justin Carpentier received his degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with highest honor from [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieur de Cachan](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/) in 2013. In 2014, he was a visiting student inside the [Optimization in Robotics and Biomechanics](http://orb.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) group with Katja Mombaur at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. 

Since September 2014, he has been a PhD candidate in the [Gepetto research group](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php) at LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse. His research is devoted to the understanding of the computational fundations of anthropomorphic locomotion. On one side, he tries to highligth the mechanismes underlying bipedalism among human beings. On the other side, he develops new mathematical formulations for the locomotion of humanoid robots.

## Main collabarotors
